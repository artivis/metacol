# metacol
A (chaotic) collection of meta-programming tools & tricks.

This repo is mainly thought as a post-it like reminder of things I came across.

The code is constrained by being 'stuck' with cpp11.

When possible, the source is mentioned directly in the file.

Organized as follows :

- 'vs' folder contains utilities related to *value-space* meta-prog.
- 'ts' folder contains utilities related to *type-space* meta-prog.
- 'ms' folder contains utilities related to *mess-space* meta-prog (sfinae).
